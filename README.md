# Paranthesis-Checker
Paranthesis usage checker
The methods in this class checks if paranthesis or brackets used in correct order.
I accomplished this task by doing:

1. Removed characters in a given string other than paranthesises. 
2. Than replaced paranthesis pairs with an empty string
3. At the end if i had an empty string, it meant paranthesis order are correct,
4. Else incorrect.
